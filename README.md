## 🧪 Usage Flow

1. Upload a PDF résumé (max 5 MB, text-based).  
2. Paste the job description (≥ 50 words recommended).  
3. Choose an OpenRouter model (several free presets provided).  
4. Review the premium analysis dashboard and fit score.  
5. Regenerate the résumé using your preferred template and download or copy the Markdown.

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- Free OpenRouter models may throttle heavy usage; the UI surfaces friendly errors and retry messaging.
- Scanned or image-based PDFs are not yet supported (OCR pipeline is on the roadmap).
- Now there are issues rendering the PDF! I've been working on fixing the issue for the last two days! I’ll fix it soon :(
